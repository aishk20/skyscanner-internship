# cra-template-backpack

The purpose of this repository is to store the Backpack template that is to be used when creating new web projects using [Backpack React Scripts](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-react-scripts).

The template stored here has the basic React App setup for a simple web app with Backpack dependencies installed.

# Usage

The template is to be used within the standard `create-react-app` command:

### With Backpack React Scripts

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=@skyscanner/backpack-react-scripts --template @skyscanner/backpack --use-npm
```

# More information

More information on how custom templates are built and used can be found here on the official [create-react-app docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates/).
